```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```


## The game

- The goal of the application is to guess a hidden integer between 1 and 100.

- The application tells if the entered number is too high or too low

## Example

The hidden number is calculated randomly and only once in the beginning:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
hidden = round(runif(1, min = 1, max = 100))
hidden
```

## Example (cont')

Assuming the hidden number is 12 and the user entered 7, 25,15 and 12.

The output text would be: "Higher!", "Lower!", "Lower!" and "You found the number!"

## Thanks
